                It is the pinnacle of all things French, the beloved escargot, also known as edible snails. Whilst an appetiser of snails might not sound all that appealing, we urge you not to knock it until you try it. 

                Land snails are cooked in garlic and parsley butter (among other seasonings), before being returned to their shell for serving. They are considered to be a delicacy in France so can be quite expensive but this doesn’t stop the locals! It is estimated that the French eat 40,000 metric tons of snails every year!

                Empty snail shells unearthed during archaeological excavations have led many historians to theorise that escargot could have been on dinner tables as early as prehistoric times! The ease of cultivating snails for food, as well as them being a good source of protein, meant that escargot caught on in Europe. As well as being very popular in France, snails were once very popular in Italy too. The Romans also enjoyed eating snails and reserved the food only for the elite.

            <h2>Herring (Netherlands) </h2>
            <img src="images/تنزيل (14).jpg" alt="Herring (Netherlands) ">
            <p class="p1">Arguably the most well known Dutch delicacy is that of raw herring. As a seafaring country, it comes as no surprise that fish forms an integral part of people’s diets, however, the fact that this fish is consumed raw (or cured to be exact) usually raises a few eyebrows. 

                During the Middle Ages, the Dutch began to salt and smoke herring. (You may have seen a similar kind of process used to make Peruvian ceviche.) Preserving the fish meant that it could be exported over Europe, with plans to eventually expand to the New World. The preservation process was refined over the years and vinegar was added to the mix, along with additional herbs and spices. This is the type of brine that is still most commonly used in the Netherlands today. 
                
                Herring is often served as a snack, sometimes plain or with cut pickles and onions. According to the locals, the best way to eat the herring is to grab it by the tail and hold it over your mouth. From there you eat it upwards!</p>

            <h2>Gyros (Greece)</h2>
            <img src="images/images (6).jpg" alt="Gyros (Greece)">
            <p class="p1">
                Gyros or Gyro, is arguably Greece’s most famous dish. It is usually made from pork or chicken which is cooked on a rotisserie and served alongside onion, tomato, french fries and tzatziki sauce. It is commonly sold as street food where the meat and salad will be served in pitta bread. If you buy gyros at a restaurant, it may be presented on a platter. 

                It is a particularly popular dish with the revellers who flock to the Greek islands of Corfu and Mykonos, with many having christened it the ‘Greek kebab’. Apparently, it is perfect for soaking up excessive amounts of alcohol after a heavy night. Of course, we couldn’t possibly confirm or deny… 

                Although most tourists will call the food ‘gear-ros’, ‘jee-ros’ or ‘gee-ros’, these are all mispronunciations. In the Greek language, they do not have the letter G in the sense that it is used in English. The Greek letter gamma is pronounced ‘yeh’, making the correct pronunciation of this popular street food ‘yeh-ro’.

            <h2>Fish and Chips (England) </h2>
            <img src="images/تنزيل (13).jpg" alt=" Fish and Chips (England) ">
            <p class="p1">
                For a quintessentially English lunch, head to the seaside and grab a portion of fish and chips. Although the weather is likely to be cooler than in other coastal areas in Europe, Britain has some beautiful beaches and there is nowhere better to sample this adored dish. 

                Traditionally, the fish (often haddock or cod) will be deep-fried in batter and served with chips (for our American friends: this means fries but a thicker version, not potato chips which come in a packet). Common accompaniments include mushy peas, curry sauce and gravy. 

                It is believed that fish and chips first appeared on British shores in the 1860s and at one point, there were as many as 35,000 shops dedicated to this local dish! Fish and chips were one of the only foods which were exempt from rationing during WW2 and Prime Minister Winston Churchill is on record as describing the combo as ‘the good companions’. </p>

            <h2>Paella (Spain)</h2>
            <img src="images/تنزيل (15).jpg" alt="Paella (Spain)">
            <p class="p1">
                Choosing a famous dish from Spain can be hard as there is just so much choice. Tortilla Española, gazpacho and patatas bravas are just a few of the standout names. However, none of these generates quite the international adoration as paella does.

                This rice dish originates from Valencia and comes in many different varieties, including the most traditional paella valenciana (with meat, green beans and butter beans), paella de marisco (with seafood) and paella mixta (with seafood, meat and vegetables).  It is cooked over an open fire in a speciality paella pan which is shallow with side handles. It is from this pan that paella gets its name. 

                The record for the world’s largest paella, which fed a staggering 110,000 people, was made by Spanish restauranter Juan Galbis in 2001.

            <h2>Waffles (Belgium)</h2>
            <img src="images/تنزيل (16).jpg" alt="Waffles (Belgium)">
            <p class="p1">
                That’s enough waffling about sausages, let’s move onto Belgium. There are two main types of waffles from Belgium, the Brussels waffle or the Liège waffle. The Brussels waffle is usually rectangular and comes with sweet toppings, whereas the Liège waffle is usually oval and made with a brioche type dough. 

                Waffles are made from a kind of batter that is baked into a waffle iron. They are then often served with sweet toppings such as icing sugar, strawberries and cinnamon to name a few. There are over a dozen regional types of waffles in Belgium, giving visitors plenty of options! 

                Waffles were brought to the US during the Seattle World Fair in 1962, by Maurice Vermersch. He was concerned that the Americans wouldn’t know where Brussels was located so he changed the name from Brussels waffles to Bel- Gem waffles which he hoped would better resonate with the audience. The Belgian waffle as we know it today is essentially a simplified version of the Brussels waffle.

            <h2> Pastel de Nata (Portugal)</h2>
            <img src="images/Pasteis-de-nata-2409-Blog.jpg" alt=" Pastel de Nata (Portugal)">
            <p class="p1">
                Here is one for those of you with a sweet tooth, Portugal’s famous egg custard tart. Served fresh from the oven with a dusting of cinnamon or icing sugar, these tasty treats are popular in both Portugal and former Portuguese colonies such as Brazil.

                Pastel de Nata was invented by the monks in Jerónimos Monastery in Santa Maria de Belem around the 18th century. During this period, it was commonplace for egg whites to be used for the nun’s habits, to starch them. To use up the remaining ingredients, the monks began baking the leftover yolks into pastel de nata. 

                There is a Portuguese proverb which says ‘a bride who eats a pastry will never take off her ring’. As such, it has become a part of wedding celebrations for the bride and groom to visit a traditional Portuguese bakery to indulge in a pastel de nata for good fortune.
